    REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of constraints for designing networked APIs. Instead
    of inventing custom verbs, you use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and descriptive URLs to
    communicate intent.

  <h3>Design Checklist</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify resources first (e.g., <code>/posts</code>, <code>/posts/:id/comments</code>).</li>
    <li>Rely on HTTP status codes to communicate success and errors.</li>
    <li>Return consistent JSON shapes and include hyperlinks (HATEOAS) when useful.</li>
    <li>Document versioning and authentication early.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Example Request</h3>
  <pre><code>GET /posts/42
Accept: application/json
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    A clean JSON response with the post body, author, and links to related resources makes it easy for
    clients to navigate your API without surprises.
